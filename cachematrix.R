## Matrix inversion is usually a costly computation and their may be some benefit to caching the inverse of a matrix 
## rather than compute it repeatedly (there are also alternatives to matrix inversion that we will not discuss here). 


## This function creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse.

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
  m <- NULL
  set <- function(y) {
    x <<- y
    m <<- NULL
  }
  get <- function() x
  setInv <- function(inv) m <<- inv
  getInv <- function() m
  list(set = set, get = get,
       setInv = setInv,
       getInv = getInv)

}


## This function computes the inverse of the special "matrix" returned by makeCacheMatrix above. If the inverse has already been calculated (and the matrix has not changed), then the cachesolve should retrieve the inverse from the cache

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
  m <- x$getInv()
  if(!is.null(m)) {
    message("getting cached data")
    return(m)
  }
  data <- x$get()
  m <- solve(data)
  x$setInv(m)
  m
}
